# TurtleGraphics_for_Processing

A turtle graphics library for Processing. Classic Logo-style programming with all the power of Processing.

A working Turtle class in Processing is currently being developed with all the functionality of a turtle-graphics engine.

Once this has being finished, I will convert it to a library which can be imported into Processing.
